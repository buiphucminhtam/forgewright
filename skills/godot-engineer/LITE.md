Use when the user requests 2D/3D game loop setups, node transformations, custom physics calculations, UI controls, or scene transition scripts in Godot."

# Godot Engineer (LITE)

## SOLVE Step 2: GROUND (Godot Engineer Domain Slots)
| Assumption | Check command / file read | Result | Script-produced evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project structure contains a valid main project configuration | `cat project.godot` | ... | run the check command and paste output |
| Project-specific tech stack and baseline profile are defined | `cat .forgewright/project-profile.json` | ... | run the check command and paste output |
| Active scripts, scene files, or resource catalogs are indexed | `find . -name "*.gd" -o -name "*.tscn" -o -name "*.tres"` | ... | run the check command and paste output |

## SOLVE Step 3: DECOMPOSE (Godot Engineer Domain Slots)
Format: `n. ACTION | TARGET | CHECK`

1. AUDIT | Validate node tree hierarchies, script attachments, and custom signal bindings | Verify that scripts are attached to correct node types and that signals are disconnected on scene exit to prevent dangling references.
2. IMPLEMENT | Author player movement or physics calculations scaling with delta-time parameters | Ensure frame-rate independent updates in `_physics_process(delta)` to prevent speed fluctuations on varying monitor refresh rates.
3. POOL | Set up custom node pools for high-frequency instanced objects (e.g., bullets) | Verify that objects are recycled using pre-allocated scene nodes rather than continuously calling `queue_free()` and `instantiate()`.

## Common Mistakes Checklist
- **Framerate-Dependent Updates**: Calculating node transformations, gravity, or velocities inside `_process(delta)` or `_physics_process(delta)` without applying the `delta` multiplier, causing execution speed shifts.
- **Dangling Node Memory Leaks**: Freeing scenes or sub-nodes at runtime without disconnecting custom event signals or removing child nodes from the tree, leading to orphaned memory consumption.
- **Non-Compliant File Structures**: Creating scene configuration logs or architectural docs under `docs/` using CamelCase, spaces, or uppercase letters instead of strictly lowercase kebab-case (e.g., `bullet-physics-config.md`).

### Step 1: Ground the Godot engine workspace configurations
```bash
cat .forgewright/project-profile.json
head -n 5 project.godot
```
```ini
config_version=5

[application]
config/name="Forgewright Godot RPG"
run/main_scene="res://scenes/main.tscn"
```

### Step 2: Implement a high-performance, frame-independent bullet pooled controller in GDScript
Create `res://scripts/bullet_pool.gd`:
```gdscript
extends Node2D
class_name BulletPool

@export var bullet_scene: PackedScene
@export var max_pool_size: int = 50

var pool: Array[Node2D] = []

func _ready() -> void:
	# Ground: Pre-allocate nodes inside the pool to avoid runtime stutter
	for i in range(max_pool_size):
		var bullet = bullet_scene.instantiate() as Node2D
		bullet.visible = false
		bullet.set_process(false)
		bullet.set_physics_process(false)
		add_child(bullet)
		pool.append(bullet)

# Recycle nodes dynamically
func fire_bullet(global_spawn_position: Vector2, direction: Vector2) -> Node2D:
	for bullet in pool:
		if not bullet.visible:
			bullet.global_position = global_spawn_position
			bullet.direction = direction
			bullet.visible = true
			bullet.set_process(true)
			bullet.set_physics_process(true)
			return bullet
	return null # Pool exhausted safely
```
