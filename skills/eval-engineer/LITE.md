# Eval Engineer (LITE)

## SOLVE Step 2: GROUND (Eval Engineer Domain Slots)
| Assumption | Check command / file read | Result | Script-produced evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target model configurations and thinking level overrides are active | `cat .production-grade.yaml` | ... | run the check command and paste output |
| Existing validation matrices, mock answers, or evaluation scripts are indexed | `find tests/ -name "*eval*" -o -name "*assert*" -o -name "*benchmark*"` | ... | run the check command and paste output |

## SOLVE Step 3: DECOMPOSE (Eval Engineer Domain Slots)
Format: `n. ACTION | TARGET | CHECK`

1. AUDIT | Validate system prompts, model temperatures, and completion schema constraints | Verify parameters (e.g., Temperature 1.0 on Gemini) conform to API requirements.
2. BENCHMARK | Execute automated prompt assertion loops across multiple target model providers | Confirm that output completions pass semantic constraints and structured schema validators.
3. MEASURE | Analyze model completion latency, token counts, and API spend footprints | Verify model output metrics are logged under ~/.forgewright/usage/ and stay within budget rules.

## Common Mistakes Checklist
- **Stripping Thought Signatures**: Removing or ignoring model-specific thought signatures during automated testing, causing unexpected API 400 errors.
- **No Validation Schema Assertions**: Trusting model outputs without running programmatic assertions or validation schema constraints, allowing structural hallucinations to slip through.
- **Parallel Thread API Throttling**: Running intensive, multi-worker prompt validation sweeps without implementing back-off delays, triggering API rate limit blocks.
- **Non-Compliant File Names**: Storing prompt evaluations, metric boards, or benchmark results under `docs/` using CamelCase or spaces instead of strictly lowercase kebab-case (e.g., `docs/04-testing/EvalResults.md` instead of `docs/04-testing/eval-results-report.md`).

### Step 1: Ground target project evaluation settings
```bash
cat .production-grade.yaml | grep -E "(gemini|thinking)" -A 2
cat .forgewright/budget.yaml
```

### Step 2: Run a secure prompt completion assertion in `tests/eval_prompt.py`
```python
import json

def calculate_quality_score(completion_text: str) -> dict:
    # Grounded Check: Ensure structured output holds valid JSON properties
    try:
        data = json.loads(completion_text)
        confidence = data.get("confidence", 0.0)
        has_citations = len(data.get("citations", [])) > 0

        # Scoring metrics mapping to standard Quality Gate (0-100)
        score = 0
        if confidence > 0.8:
            score += 50
        if has_citations:
            score += 50

        grade = "A" if score >= 90 else "B" if score >= 80 else "F"
        return {"score": score, "grade": grade, "status": "PASS" if score >= 90 else "FAIL"}
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError) as err:
        return {"score": 0, "grade": "F", "status": "FAIL", "error": str(err)}

# Validate mock output completion
print(calculate_quality_score('{"confidence": 0.95, "citations": [""]}'))
```

### Step 3: Run the prompt validator and check token usage metrics
```bash
python3 tests/eval_prompt.py
forge token status || cat ~/.forgewright/usage/summary.json
```
